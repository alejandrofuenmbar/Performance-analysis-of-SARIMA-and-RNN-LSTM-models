# Performance-analysis-of-SARIMA-and-RNN-LSTM-models
Performance analysis of SARIMA and RNN (LSTM) models for the prediction of airline passenger numbers in the United States.
This project compares the performance of two different time series models: a SARIMA model and a recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units. The models are used to predict the number of airline passengers in the United States from 1949 to 1960.

The study finds that both models are capable of predicting the number of airline passengers with reasonable accuracy. However, the LSTM model has a slightly better performance than the SARIMA model. This is because the LSTM model is able to capture long-term relationships between the data, which is important for time series forecasting.
